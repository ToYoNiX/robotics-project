# Sumo Robot Project
Welcome to the Sumo Robot Project repository! This project, developed as part of a college assignment, focuses on building a versatile and powerful sumo robot using the ESP32 development board. Our aim was to create a robust and adaptable robot capable of competing in sumo robot competitions.

# Components
1. LN298N Motor Driver
The LN298N motor driver is a crucial component that allows us to control the motors of our sumo robot effectively. It provides bidirectional control for two motors, making it ideal for robotics projects.

2. Rechargeable Batteries
We utilized three 3.7V rechargeable batteries to power our sumo robot. These batteries offer sufficient power to drive the motors and other components while being rechargeable for convenience.

3. 12V Motor
The 12V motor we used in our project is capable of rotating up to 500 RPM (Rotations Per Minute). This motor provides the necessary torque and speed for our sumo robot to maneuver effectively on the competition arena.

4. NodeMCU ESP32
The NodeMCU ESP32 serves as the brain of our sumo robot. With its built-in Wi-Fi module, the ESP32 enables wireless communication and control, allowing for both autonomous operation and remote control via a dedicated mobile application.

5. Ultrasonic Sensor
The ultrasonic sensor is a key sensor used in our sumo robot for detecting obstacles and opponents. It emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back, enabling our robot to perceive its surroundings accurately.

# Control Options
Our sumo robot offers two primary control options:

* Autonomous Mode: In this mode, the robot operates independently using pre-programmed algorithms to navigate the arena and engage with opponents.

* Mobile Application Control: We have developed a custom mobile application specifically designed to interact with the ESP32 via Wi-Fi. This intuitive application allows users to control the robot remotely, providing real-time feedback and control options.
